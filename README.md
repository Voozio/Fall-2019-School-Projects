# Fall-2019-School-Projects

# The project I am proudest of this semester is from CSC 137 titled Subneg. Java is used to simulate an assembly compiler and instructions are fed into the program through text files. Using only numbers, subtraction, and jumping, I was able to recreate loops and the fibonacci sequence.
